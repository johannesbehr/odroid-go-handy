Retro emulation for the ODROID-GO

This is just a fork containing a simple change to how the menu button works.

When playing a game, quick pressing the menu button will just take you back to the menu, and long-pressing the menu button will save the gamestate and then take you back to the menu. This allows you to return to the menu without having to save the gamestate. With the unforked version, the only way of doing this is to use the power switch.
